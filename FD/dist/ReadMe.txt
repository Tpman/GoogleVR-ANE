This demo apk is built with shared runtime but nothing can stop you from building your own final product in captive mode!
We used shared packaging just because the final size of the .apk is much smaller and it will be easier for people to download
the github project.

Shared compiled .apk files will run only if the official Adobe Air app is installed on your device.

NOTICE: On older Android devices you may see your AIR content all black when you return from the 360 video view This is an old bug in AIR and we hope Adobe would find the reason and hopefully fix it someday. In the meanwhile, read this to fix the problem: http://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/ane-fix-for-blackblank-screen-bug-when-returning-to-air-android-apps
